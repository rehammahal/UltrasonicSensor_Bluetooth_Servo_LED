# UltrasonicSensor_Bluetooth_Servo_LED

This task requires designing a circuit for robot of welcoming.

I used an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance of people who stand in front of the robot of welcoming, also used a Bluetooth piece for sending a signal to the robot's screen to start video of welcome (Here, I used LED instead of video software).

Also, I used a servo to making the robot moves its arms to do welcome or may give hugs.
